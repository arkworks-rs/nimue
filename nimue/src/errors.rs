/// The [`nimue`] package has two types of errors:
/// [`IOPatternError`], which is the error exposed in the low-level interface for bytes and native elements,
/// which arises whenever the IO Pattern specified and the IO pattern executed mismatch.
/// [`ProofError`], which is the error exposed to high-level interfaces dealing with structured types and
/// for end-user applications.
/// Three types of errors can happen when dealing with [`ProofError`]:
///
/// - Serialization/Deseralization errors ([`ProofError::SerializationError`]):
///   This includes all potential problems when extracting a particular type from sequences of bytes.
///
/// - Invalid Proof format ([`ProofError::InvalidIO`]):
///   At a higher level, a proof object have to respect the same length and the same types as the protocol description.
///   This error is a wrapper under the [`IOPatternError`] and provides convenient dereference/conversion implementations for
///   moving from/to an [`IOPatternError`].
///
/// - Invalid Proof:
///   An error to signal that the verification equation has failed. Destined for end users.
///
/// A [`core::Result::Result`] wrapper called [`ProofResult`] (having error fixed to [`ProofError`]) is also provided.
